# Solving Leetcode Challenges
In this repository I'm posting my solutions to coding challenges on **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)**.

The main goal is to keep track of my consistency in improving my ability to solve problems.

## Install packages:
```
npm install
```

## Install typescript (if it's missing):
```
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

## Create tsconfig.json file (if it's missing):

```

## Start "tsc watch" to compile to JS file on save:
